// |                welcome to C-LINGS                  |
// | So you want to learn the C language. Great choice! |
// | C is a rather old language but there is a reason it|
// | is  still in  use and it is  also a  language that |
// | teaches a  lot of low  level concepts  like memory |
// | management  and many  other things  which we  will |
// | one after  another in  this course,  starting with |
// | displaying something on the terminal.              |
// |                                                    |
// | This program is inspired by projects like ziglings |
// | and rustlings                                      |

// this is an import. Ignore this for now
#include <stdio.h>

// This is the main function. It is the entry point of the program
int main() {
    // printf is a function given to us from the stdio library
    //
    // TODO: Make this program print "hello world" on the screen
    // ???("hello world");
    printf("hello world");

    // this signals that the program exited with no errors
    return 0;
